# Find My Bus

Find My Bus is a web application that allows users to find buses with estimated fares by route or destination. While the project includes a location tracking feature, please be aware that this feature is currently in a demo/simulation mode and does not provide real-time bus location data. We are actively working on improving this feature.

In the meantime, you can still use the application to find buses and estimated fares based on route or destination. We apologize for any inconvenience and appreciate your understanding as we continue to enhance this functionality.

## Features

- Real-time bus tracking on a map.
- Search for buses by route or destination.
- Detailed information about each bus, including its current location and estimated arrival time.
- User-friendly interface with responsive design.

## Technologies Used

- Flask: A Python web framework for building the backend of the application.
- HTML and Bootstrap: Used for creating the frontend and ensuring a responsive layout.
- Firebase: Used for storing and retrieving bus location data in real-time.
- OpenStreetMap: Provides map data and mapping functionality for displaying bus locations.
